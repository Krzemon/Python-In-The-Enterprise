# copy the code of your friend, preferably as separate files to this repository
# Test all of the methods in their code, or at least 10 unittest tests (that make sense).
# Your test must be runnable with the command `python -m unittest task`

# Car Simulation Test Descriptions

## Test Summaries

- **test_start_engine_and_drive**: Checks if the car successfully starts the engine, begins driving, and reaches a speed greater than 0.

- **test_accelerate_and_brake**: Verifies that speed increases when the car accelerates and decreases when it brakes.

- **test_enter_and_exit_highway**: Tests the car's state while entering and exiting the highway, including checking for speed limits on regular roads after exiting.

- **test_overtake_and_truck**: Ensures the carâ€™s speed is correctly set during overtaking and when following a truck.

- **test_stop**: Confirms that the car comes to a complete stop with a speed of 0 and is no longer marked as "on the road."
