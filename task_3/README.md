# Class diary

## Create program for handling lesson scores.
Use python to handle student (highscool) class scores, and attendance.
Make it possible to:
- Get students total average score (average across classes)
- get students average score in class
- hold students name and surname
- Count total attendance of student

Please, use your imagination and create more functionalities.
Your project should be able to handle entire school(s?).
If you have enough courage and time, try storing (reading/writing)
data in text files (YAML, JSON).
If you have even more courage, try implementing user interface (might be text-like).

Try to expand your implementation as best as you can. 
Think of as many features as you can, and try implementing them.
Make intelligent use of pythons syntactic sugar (overloading, iterators, generators, etc)
Most of all: CREATE GOOD, RELIABLE, READABLE CODE.
The goal of this task is for you to SHOW YOUR BEST python programming skills.
Impress everyone with your skills, show off with your code.

Show some usecases of your library in the code (print some things)
